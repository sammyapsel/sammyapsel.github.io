## Projects
### **M.Sc. Project : Remote Acoustic Sensing of Laser Speckle Patterns**
- Developed a computer vision-based method utilizing image processing and cross-correlation algorithms to remotely extract biomedical acoustic signals
(speech, lung sounds, heartbeats) up to 62.5 kHz from laser speckle patterns captured with a low-FPS rolling-shutter camera.
- Improved SNR by 12.8 dB compared to previous techniques with enhanced filtering and optical design.
